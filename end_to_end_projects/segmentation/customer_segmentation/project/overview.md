PRODUCT: <!--[what and why] -->

The project is a solution to address the business problem of customer segmentation by using
unsupervised Machine Learning techniques.The aim is to use a clustering algorithm to group
similarly characterised customers with the hopes of creating a personalised marketing
strategy for each customer segmentation.
<!--unsupervised technique of clustering. Alternatives to using ML to segment customer data:-->
RELEVANCE:

Creating segmentation of the customer base allows the business to have a clearer picture of the type of customers
that interact with their product/s. Referencing a <b>Customer Journey Map</b>,with the entities of 'Awareness' -> 'Consideration'
-> 'Decision' -> 'Delivery' -> 'Loyalty and Advocation', customer segmentation aids in the identification of the type of customers
that are already interested in the product/service that can help with marketing solutions ('Consideration') and the identifying of 
the actions taken by customers after use with product/service ('Loyalty and Advocation').
BACKGROUND:

RELEASES:
<!-- - [x] #1 will be a basic model that clusters the customers based on the features of gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The clustering will partition the customers, meaning all customers are placed in a group. -->
CONCERNS:


OBJECTIVES:
<!-- - (what are the key objectives to specific criteria/metrics) -->

SOLUTIONS:
<!-- - (what are the possible solutions that have been) -->

FEASIBILITY
<!-- - (think about dependencies and testing of hypotheses) -->

CONSTRAINTS:
<!-- - (SLAs {service-level agreements} with customers and internal system -- time, money, performance,latency, infrastructure, privacy,security, UI/UX) -->

INTEGRATION:
<!-- - (the dependencies and consumers to integrate, own company (different systems, teams, conflicts)) -->
