PRODUCT: <!--[what and why] -->

The project is a solution to address the business problem of customer segmentation by using
unsupervised Machine Learning techniques.The aim is to use a clustering algorithm to group
similarly characterised customers with the hopes of creating a personalised marketing
strategy for each customer segmentation.
<!--unsupervised technique of clustering. Alternatives to using ML to segment customer data:-->
RELEVANCE:


BACKGROUND:


RELEASES:
<!-- - [x] #1 will be a basic model that clusters the customers based on the features of gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The clustering will partition the customers, meaning all customers are placed in a group. -->
CONCERNS:


OBJECTIVES:
<!-- - (what are the key objectives to specific criteria/metrics) -->

SOLUTIONS:
<!-- - (what are the possible solutions that have been) -->

FEASIBILITY
<!-- - (think about dependencies and testing of hypotheses) -->

CONSTRAINTS:
<!-- - (SLAs {service-level agreements} with customers and internal system -- time, money, performance,latency, infrastructure, privacy,security, UI/UX) -->

INTEGRATION:
<!-- - (the dependencies and consumers to integrate, own company (different systems, teams, conflicts)) -->
