The project addresses the business problem of finding value within the customer database. A solution is to find similarly characterised customers and cluster them within a group; this allows the business to more efficiently find insight by focusing on each cluster segmentation rather than the entire customer database. The model output is applicable for further exploration by creating personalised marketing strategies for each customer cluster.
